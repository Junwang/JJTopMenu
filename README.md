JJTopMenu
=========

[Beta] Simple top menu with selected indicator.

How to use it
=============

Import this on your controller:

    #import "JJTopMenuViewController.h"

Add a [private] strong property to your controller:

    @interface MyViewController ()

    @property (nonatomic, strong) JJTopMenuViewController *menuVC;

    @end


Then instantiate the JJTopMenuViewController, maybe on your viewDidLoad:

    self.menuVC = [[JJTopMenuViewController alloc] initWithMenuItems:@[ [JJMenuItem initWithTitle:@"item 1" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"forkandknife"] badgeValue:nil], [JJMenuItem initWithTitle:@"item 2" image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"pinetree"] badgeValue:nil]] selectedItemColor:[UIColor redColor] selectedItemTextColor:[UIColor grayColor] itemTextColor:[UIColor blueColor]];

Here, you can set the Items for the menu (right now you can set the title and the image, the badgeValue is not ready) and the properties:

    selectedItemColor // The color of the underline for the selected item
    selectedItemTextColor // The color of the text for the selected item
    itemTextColor // The color of the normal state of the items
    TODO: Add custom font, background and alignment

After this, make the layout specific settings for the frame of the view on JJTopMenuViewController and add it to the superview:

    self.menuVC.view.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.bounds.size.width, 60);
    [self.view addSubview:self.menuVC.view];

Set the delegate to handle the menu items selection:

    self.menuVC.delegate = self;


The only (till now) method available on the protocol is the didSelectMenuItemAtIndex:

    -(void)topMenu:(JJTopMenuViewController *)menu didSelectMenuItemAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
    

And this is it. All your feedback is appreciated!
